The average_data.txt file contains 68 variables. 

Each row corresponds to the average value of the mean or standard deviation of the selected feature variables for a specific activiy perfomed by a specific subject. The average values were calculated by grouping all available observations by subject id and activity label.

The description of the 68 variables in the average_data.txt files are given below:
